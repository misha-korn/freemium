# Roadmap

## Stage 1 — Foundation ✅ (done)
- [x] Custom `User` (AbstractUser) + django-allauth (login/signup/logout/reset)
- [x] `Subscription` model + auto-create-on-signup signal
- [x] `Portfolio`, `Asset`, `Transaction` models (Decimal money)
- [x] Manual trade entry (CRUD), ownership-scoped views
- [x] Computed positions + cost basis (`services.compute_positions`)
- [x] App skeletons: marketdata (provider abstraction), analytics (XIRR), billing, notifications
- [x] Split settings, Docker, design system, 85% test coverage, ruff-clean

## Stage 2 — Quotes & analytics ✅ (done)
- [x] Wire Celery + Redis; periodic `refresh_active_quotes` (Celery Beat, 15-min default)
- [x] Persist `PriceQuote` (`marketdata.services.store/fetch/latest_quotes`); current market value per position
- [x] Returns: simple + money-weighted XIRR wired into `portfolio.valuation`
- [x] First portfolio chart — cumulative invested capital over time (Chart.js)
- [x] FX handling (`marketdata.fx`) for multi-currency base-currency aggregation
- [x] Manual "Refresh prices" action + 36 new tests (89% coverage, ruff-clean)

### Stage 2 honesty notes (carry into later stages)
- No quote ⇒ position shows `priced=False` / `—`; we never invent a price.
- Base-currency totals appear only when every currency converts (else `missing_fx`).
- The chart plots **invested capital** (needs no historical prices). True
  mark-to-market history needs a price backfill / daily snapshots — a later stage.
- FX rates are a static `settings.FX_RATES` stop-gap; swap in a live feed later.

## Stage 3 — MVP dashboard ✅ (done)
- [x] Allocation breakdowns by holding / asset class / market / currency
      (`portfolio.allocation`), rendered as Chart.js donuts on the dashboard
- [x] Polished portfolio dashboard: headline stats + allocation + invested chart
- [x] Account overview on the portfolio list: per-portfolio cards + a combined
      single-currency total (`portfolio.overview`)
- [x] Deploy: Render Blueprint (`render.yaml`) for web + worker + beat + Postgres
      + Redis; `Procfile` + `bin/release.sh` for VPS/Docker; Render hostname
      trusted automatically in `prod.py`
- [x] 90% test coverage, ruff-clean

### Stage 3 honesty notes (carry into later stages)
- Allocation uses **market value** only when every position is priced; otherwise
  it falls back to **invested capital** and says so. Unconvertible currencies are
  excluded and listed in `missing_fx` — never mixed without a rate.
- Industry **sector** is intentionally *not* shown: `Asset` has no sector and no
  provider feeds one. Added only when a real data source exists.
- "Performance" is current returns (simple + XIRR) + the invested-capital chart;
  true value-over-time still needs the deferred price backfill / daily snapshots.

## Stage 3.5 — deferred polish (nice-to-have)
- [ ] Industry-sector allocation once a provider feed exists
- [ ] Mark-to-market value-over-time chart (price backfill or `PortfolioSnapshot`)
- [ ] Self-host Chart.js (or SRI + CSP nonce) instead of the CDN tag

## Stage 4 — Monetisation
- [ ] Free/Pro limits enforced (e.g. 1 portfolio on Free)
- [ ] Payment provider integration + verified webhooks → activate Pro
- [ ] "Pro-only" feature gating

## Stage 5 — Retention & growth
- [ ] Yearly tax report; Excel/PDF export
- [ ] Email/Telegram digests & price alerts
- [ ] Broker auto-import (e.g. Tinkoff Invest API)
