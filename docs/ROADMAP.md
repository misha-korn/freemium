# Roadmap

## Stage 1 — Foundation ✅ (done)
- [x] Custom `User` (AbstractUser) + django-allauth (login/signup/logout/reset)
- [x] `Subscription` model + auto-create-on-signup signal
- [x] `Portfolio`, `Asset`, `Transaction` models (Decimal money)
- [x] Manual trade entry (CRUD), ownership-scoped views
- [x] Computed positions + cost basis (`services.compute_positions`)
- [x] App skeletons: marketdata (provider abstraction), analytics (XIRR), billing, notifications
- [x] Split settings, Docker, design system, 85% test coverage, ruff-clean

## Stage 2 — Quotes & analytics ✅ (done)
- [x] Wire Celery + Redis; periodic `refresh_active_quotes` (Celery Beat, 15-min default)
- [x] Persist `PriceQuote` (`marketdata.services.store/fetch/latest_quotes`); current market value per position
- [x] Returns: simple + money-weighted XIRR wired into `portfolio.valuation`
- [x] First portfolio chart — cumulative invested capital over time (Chart.js)
- [x] FX handling (`marketdata.fx`) for multi-currency base-currency aggregation
- [x] Manual "Refresh prices" action + 36 new tests (89% coverage, ruff-clean)

### Stage 2 honesty notes (carry into later stages)
- No quote ⇒ position shows `priced=False` / `—`; we never invent a price.
- Base-currency totals appear only when every currency converts (else `missing_fx`).
- The chart plots **invested capital** (needs no historical prices). True
  mark-to-market history needs a price backfill / daily snapshots — a later stage.
- FX rates are a static `settings.FX_RATES` stop-gap; swap in a live feed later.

## Stage 3 — MVP dashboard
- [ ] Allocation by asset / sector / currency
- [ ] Performance view; polished dashboard
- [ ] Deploy to a VPS / Render

## Stage 4 — Monetisation
- [ ] Free/Pro limits enforced (e.g. 1 portfolio on Free)
- [ ] Payment provider integration + verified webhooks → activate Pro
- [ ] "Pro-only" feature gating

## Stage 5 — Retention & growth
- [ ] Yearly tax report; Excel/PDF export
- [ ] Email/Telegram digests & price alerts
- [ ] Broker auto-import (e.g. Tinkoff Invest API)
